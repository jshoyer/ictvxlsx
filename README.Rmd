My goal here
is to make it a little bit easier
to use tables
from the ICTV
(the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses)
in R,
either directly
or via dedicated R packages,
tracked on branches.

## History of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
