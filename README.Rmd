My goal here
is to make it a little bit easier
to use tables
from the ICTV
(the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses)
in R,
either directly
or via dedicated R packages,
tracked on branches.

Depending on your goal,
you might not need to use R at all.
If you want to quickly browse the taxonomic hierarchy
from the top down,
the ICTV site
includes a nice [visual browser](https://ictv.global/taxonomy/visual-browser)
for current and past versions.
Another interactive view
that is cross-referenced by annotated host distribution
is at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus
(NCBI = US National Center for Biotechnology Information).
The NCBI Taxonomy database
provides a text-based hierarchical browser
that can be used to access many types of data
for each taxon.
As noted by Siddell et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001840))
in a paper on the role of the ICTV,
the NCBI Taxonomy team
uses ICTV releases
but there is a short lag each time,
so it can be worthwhile to cross-reference the ICTV tables.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

msl2022 <-
  read_excel("ICTV_Master_Species_List_2022_MSL38.v3.xlsx",
             sheet = 2, .name_repair = "universal")

vmr2022 <-
  read_excel("VMR_MSL38_v2.xlsx",
             sheet = 1, .name_repair = "universal")

vmr2022_e <- filter(vmr2022,
                    Exemplar.or.additional.isolate == "E") %>%
  select(-Exemplar.or.additional.isolate)

msl2022_e <- left_join(msl2022, vmr2022_e,
                       by = c("Realm", "Subrealm", "Kingdom", "Subkingdom",
                              "Phylum", "Subphylum", "Class", "Subclass",
                              "Order", "Suborder", "Family", "Subfamily",
                              "Genus", "Subgenus", "Species",
                              "Genome.Composition" = "Genome.composition"))
```

## History of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
