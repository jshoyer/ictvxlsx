My goal here
is to make it a little bit easier
to use tables
from the ICTV
(the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses)
in R,
either directly
or via dedicated R packages,
tracked on branches.

Depending on your goal,
you might not need to use R at all.
If you want to quickly browse the taxonomic hierarchy
from the top down,
the ICTV site
includes a nice [visual browser](https://ictv.global/taxonomy/visual-browser)
for current and past versions.
Another interactive view
that is cross-referenced by annotated host distribution
is at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus
(NCBI = US National Center for Biotechnology Information).
The NCBI Taxonomy database
provides a text-based hierarchical browser
that can be used to access many types of data
for each taxon.
As noted by Siddell et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001840))
in a paper on the role of the ICTV,
the NCBI Taxonomy team
uses ICTV releases
but there is a short lag each time,
so it can be worthwhile to cross-reference the ICTV tables.

## History of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
