My goal here
is to use historical tables
from the ICTV
via a dedicated R package.
Historical Excel files
can be downloaded in bulk
from https://ictv.global/msl
(check the box at the top
 to select all versions.)
Move downloaded versions of the MSL
to inst/doc/
and remove the minor-update versions
with the shell script in that directory
to get a 1-per-year set.

## Possible more-refined approaches to the history of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
