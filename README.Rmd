As noted by Siddell et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001840))
in a paper on the role of the ICTV,
the NCBI Taxonomy team
uses ICTV releases
but there is a short lag each time,
so it can be worthwhile to cross-reference the ICTV tables.

It might be useful
to read in Excel tables
from selected pending taxonomy proposals,
given the lag before the major annual release.
Might it be useful
to programmatically cross-reference
such tables
against the NCBI Taxonomy?

## History of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
