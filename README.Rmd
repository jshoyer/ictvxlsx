My goal here
is to make it a little bit easier
to use tables
from the ICTV
(the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses)
in R,
via a dedicated R package.
Historical Excel files
can be downloaded in bulk
from https://ictv.global/msl
and https://ictv.global/vmr.

## Possible more-refined approaches to the history of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
