As noted by Siddell et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001840))
in a paper on the role of the ICTV,
the NCBI Taxonomy team
uses ICTV releases
but there is a short lag each time,
so it can be worthwhile to cross-reference the ICTV tables.

## History of the taxonomy
Others have considered using one or more R packages
to access the full history of the taxonomy,
including taxon merging, splitting, reassignment-moves, and renaming
(taxa package [issue 136](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/136)
 and linked taxize issue 695).
